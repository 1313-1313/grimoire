 I wanted to use Blizzard's API but there was some problems with CORS and Codepen? :(
So for now I'm using my own fixture data (hence why only a couple of examples)... I'd like to get this into a plugin maybe using Blizzard's API. 

Oh also the tooltip positioning is a little whack as I didn't write comprehensive mouse-tracking... but I wanted to prove my concept mostly ^_^;

Hope you like it! :)
