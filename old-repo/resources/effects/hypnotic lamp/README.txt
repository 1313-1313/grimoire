This one was a bit trickier than my [Fractured](http://codepen.io/cmegown/pen/vyjNWO) pen, where the viewport was completely filled by the animated elements and `mix-blend-mode` just kind of worked as expected. That was not the case this time around, and it was just a _touch_ more difficult to get the desired effect.
