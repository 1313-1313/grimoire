            'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
            %br/
            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

            All mimsy were the borogoves,
            %br/
            And the mome raths outgrabe.

            "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
            %br/
            The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
            %br/
            Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
            %br/
            The frumious Bandersnatch!"

            He took his vorpal sword in hand:
            %br/
            Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”
            %br/
            So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
            %br/
            And stood awhile in thought.
        %p
            And, as in uffish thought he stood,
            %br/
            The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
            %br/
            Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
            %br/
            And burbled as it came!
        %p
            One, two! One, two! and through and through
            %br/
            The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
            %br/
            He left it dead, and with its head
            %br/
            He went galumphing back.

            Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
            %br/
            O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"

            He chortled in his joy.
